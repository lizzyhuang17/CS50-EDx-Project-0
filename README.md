# Project 0

This is my project for Harvard EDx CS50 Web Programming with HTML, CSS, and Python. My website has a lot of basic information about me. It includes some facts about me, my hobbies, my favorite foods, where I have traveled, and my weekly schedule. It has tables, images, and lists. Through this website, people can get a good idea of who I am.
